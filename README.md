Dart Angular
==================

This is a base AngularJS Application which consumes a dart sub-module

Part of my Dart experiments with AngularJS and Backone

npm install

You will need to also fetch the latest of the sub module to run this

so remember to do:

git submodule foreach git pull origin master

This will pull all the latest submodules down.


```
grunt devserver
```
